log2(8) = 3  -->  2^3 = 8

log2(value) = exponent --> 2 exponent = value

// Not a math course, so here's a rule of thumb

The logarithm of a number roughly measures the number of times you can divide that number by 2 before you get a value that is less than or equal to one.


8 % 2
4 % 2
2 % 2
1

log(8) = 3

25 / 2
12.5 / 2
6.25 / 2
3.125 / 2
1.5625 / 2
0.78125

log(25) = 4.64

Logarithmic time complexity is great.

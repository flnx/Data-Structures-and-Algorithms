Simplification.

O(2n) > O(n)

O(500) > O(1) - constant run time

O(13n^2) > O(n^2)

O(n + 10) > O(n)
O(1000n + 50) > O(n)
O(n^2 + 5^n + 8) > O(n^2)

Analyzing complexity with Big O can get complicated.

Big O Shorthands.

1. Arithmetic operations are constant. Your computer takes almost the same amount of time to run 2 + 2 as it does 1 000 000 + 2
2. Variable assignment is constant
3. Accessing elements in an array (by index) or object (by key) is constant run time as well.
4. In a loop times the complexity of whatever happens inside of the loop.

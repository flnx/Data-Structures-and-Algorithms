Ordered list! []

They store different types of data, mix it up. 
Each element has an index (a numeric value) that corresponds to it

When to use arrays

1. When you need order
2. When you need fast access / insertion and removal (sort of...)

* Insertion - it depends...
* Removal - it depends...
* Searching - O(n)
* Access - O(1)

Access:

let names = ["Michael", "Melissa", "Andrea"];

* names[0] // Michael  O(1) - Instant access
* names[1] // Melissa  O(1) - Instant access
* names[2] // Andrea   O(1) - Instant access

Insertion:

names.push("Raj"); // O(1) - Constant Time

The problem comes if we try to insert it at the beggining of an array.
The reason is with the indexes;

names.unshift("Raj");

All indexes are changed;

names = ["Raj", "Michael", "Melissa", "Andrea"];

* Reindexing is not a trivial operation - O(n)
* The amount of time takes grows roughly grows with  proportion with the size of the array(n)
